__Question:-__
Define the use of AI in robotics. list the areas where Robotics can be applied.

Ans:-
Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in robotics to enable robots to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do. This can include tasks such as object recognition, navigation, and decision making.

There are many areas where robotics can be applied, including manufacturing, healthcare, and domestic tasks. In manufacturing, robots are often used to perform tasks such as welding, painting, and assembly. In healthcare, robots can be used for tasks such as surgery and rehabilitation. Domestic robots can be used for tasks such as vacuuming and lawn mowing.

Other potential applications of robotics include space exploration, search and rescue, and military operations. The use of robotics in these areas can help to improve safety and efficiency.

AI in robotics typically involves the use of artificial intelligence algorithms to enable robots to learn, plan, and make decisions. AI can be used to give robots the ability to autonomously navigate complex environments or to interact with humans. AI can also be used to allow robots to learn how to perform tasks, recognize objects, and respond to voice commands. AI can also be used to enhance the safety of robots by helping them avoid obstacles and people, as well as to reduce energy consumption.

__Question:-__
Explain PEAS in detail with an example

Ans:-
PEAS is a framework for evaluating and comparing different artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It stands for Performance, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors, and it is used to describe the key characteristics of an AI system in terms of these four factors. The PEAS framework is useful for comparing different AI systems and understanding their capabilities and limitations.

The Performance of an AI system is a measure of how well the system can achieve its goals or objectives. This can include factors such as the accuracy of the system's predictions or decisions, the speed at which it can operate, and the quality of the solutions it can produce.

The Environment of an AI system is the context in which the system operates. This can include factors such as the type of data the system has access to, the constraints or limitations on the system's actions, and the objectives or goals of the system.

The Actuators of an AI system are the mechanisms by which the system can take actions in the environment. This can include sensors that collect data from the environment, as well as actuators that can manipulate the environment in some way, such as moving a robot or sending a command to a device.

The Sensors of an AI system are the mechanisms by which the system can perceive the environment and collect data. This can include sensors that measure physical properties of the environment, such as temperature or light, as well as sensors that collect information from other sources, such as cameras or microphones.

An example of using the PEAS framework to describe an AI system is a self-driving car. The Performance of the self-driving car might be measured in terms of its ability to navigate roads safely and efficiently. The Environment of the self-driving car might include the roads and traffic it encounters, as well as the weather and other conditions. The Actuators of the self-driving car might include its wheels and steering mechanism, as well as sensors such as cameras and radar. The Sensors of the self-driving car might include cameras and radar that can detect other vehicles and obstacles on the road.
