8.  Importance of the congestion avoidance algorithm? Methods to manage the congestion in
    the network?


## Answers.

__1 ) ans__:-
-   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
-   It is a method for assigning Internet Protocol (IP) addresses permanently or to individual computers in an organisations network
-   DHCP lets a network administrator supervise and distribute IP addresses from a central point and automatically sends a new IP address when a computer is plugged into a different place in the network

__2 ) ans:-__
-

 SECOND GENERATION (2G)  

-   2G refers to the second generation of mobile networks based on GSM. The radio signals used by the 1G network were analog, while 2G networks were digital. 2G capabilities were achieved by allowing multiple users on a single channel via multiplexing. During 2G, cellular phones were used for data along with voice. Some of the key features of 2G were:
-   Data speeds of up to [64 kbps](https://www.etsi.org/technologies/mobile/2g)
-   Use of digital signals instead of analog
-   Enabled services such as SMS and MMS (Multimedia Message)
-   Provided better quality voice calls
-   It used a bandwidth of 30 to 200 KHz
    

 THIRD GENERATION (3G)  

-   The 3G standard utilises Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) as its core network architecture. 3G network combines aspects of the 2G network with new technologies and protocols to deliver a significantly faster data rate. By using packet switching, the original technology was improved to allow speeds up to 14 Mbps. It used Wide Band Wireless Network that increased clarity. It operates at a range of 2100 MHz and has a bandwidth of 15-20 MHz. Some of the main features of 3G are:
-   Speed of up to 2 Mbps
-   Increased bandwidth and data transfer rates
-   Send/receive large email messages
-   Large capacities and broadband capabilities
    
[International Mobile Telecommunications-2000](https://www.itu.int/osg/imt-project/docs/What_is_IMT2000-2.pdf) (IMT-2000) were the specifications by the International Telecommunication Union for the 3G network; theoretically, 21.6 Mbps is the max speed of HSPA+.

 FOURTH GENERATION (4G)  

-   The main difference between 3G and 4G is the data rate. There is also a huge difference between 3G and 4G technology. The key technologies that have made 4G possible are MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) and OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing). The most important 4G standards are WiMAX and LTE. While 4G LTE is a major improvement over 3G speeds, it is technically not 4G. What is the difference between 4G and LTE?
    
-   Even after it was widely available, many networks were not up to the required speed of 4G. 4G LTE is a “fourth generation long term evolution”, capable of delivering a very fast and secure internet connection. Basically, 4G is the predetermined standard for mobile network connections. 4G LTE is the term given to the path which has to be followed to achieve those predefined standards. Some of the features of 4G LTE are:
-   Support interactive multimedia, voice, video.
-   High speed, high capacity and low cost per bit (Speeds of up to [20 Mbps or more.](https://www3.nd.edu/~mhaenggi/NET/wireless/4G/))
-   Global and scalable mobile networks.
-   Ad hoc and multi-hop networks.
